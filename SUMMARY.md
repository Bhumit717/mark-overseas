## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Start with Option D + Option C:**

1. **First (30 min)**: Update `our-products.html` to add cards for all 57 products
   - Even without individual pages, users can see the full catalog
   - Cards can link to contact page temporarily
   - Shows immediate progress

2. **Then (2-3 hours)**: Source all remaining product images
   - Download from Unsplash/Pexels/Pixabay
   - Ensures consistent quality
   - Enables faster page creation

3. **Then (2 hours)**: Complete the 3 remaining multi-variant pages
   - product-groundnut.html
   - product-rice.html
   - product-pulses.html

4. **Finally (4-6 hours)**: Create all individual spice product pages
   - Use template from existing pages
   - Batch create for efficiency

**Total Time Estimate: 9-12 hours of work**
